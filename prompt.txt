The goal is to implement the requirements (AC1-AC8):
- AC1. My system receives the patient’s test results: alanine aminotransferase (ALT – U/L) and liver fibrosis level on the METAVIR scale F0–F4 from elastography.
- AC2. ALT above 35 U/L for women / 45 U/L for men generates a small alert.
- AC3. Fibrosis levels F1, F2, F3, and F4 generate a small alert.
- AC4. After three consecutive alarming ALT–fibrosis result pairs, taken at intervals of at least one month, we calculate the liver cancer risk level using the formula:(patient age / 70) * (median fibrosis / 4) * (mean ALT / [last ALT result + first ALT result])
- AC5. If the calculated liver cancer risk level is greater than 0.3, we generate a big alert.
- AC6. A doctor may resolve a big alert → this resolves all small alerts.
- AC7. A doctor may resolve small alerts, but when a big alert appears, small alerts cannot be resolved.
- AC8. No new alerts can be generated if a big alert has not been resolved.

Please follow my instruction.
Use typeorm to handle the database queries. You use NodeJS and TypeScript.
Right now, the src/index.ts just runs a fastify server.

Create the folder structure in the src that follows layered architecture:
- src/controllers
- src/services
- src/domain
- src/repositories

Implement the following classes in the layers. These are classes that should be placed in the domain:

1. User

Two roles: Patient and MedicalDoctor

A static method:
- addUser(dateOfBirth, sex, race)

2. Measurement

The measurementType is either ALT or fibrosis.

The methods:
- addMeasurement(user, type, value)

The Measurement should inject the Alert and invoke its checkMeasurement method

3. Alert

The statis methods:
- checkMeasurement(user, type, value)
- raiseSmallAlert
- checkIfBigAlertShouldBeRaised
- raiseBigAlert

The methods:
- resolve(). It should get, e.g. in the services layer, the alarms and the resolve method should check whether they can be resolved and resolve if that's possible.
